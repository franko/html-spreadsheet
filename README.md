# html-spreadsheet

This repository is work-in-progress.

It does contains a HTML / js implementation to mimic a spreadsheet-like table in the browser.

Currently data can be pasted from Excel but otherwise the application doesn't do anything interesting.

The main limitation of this implementation is that a input text field is used for every cell.

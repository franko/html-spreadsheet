# HTML-Spreadsheet

Provides very simple spreadsheet-like data tables to copy & paste and edit data in tabular form.

![Demonstration of HTML-Spreadsheet](https://github.com/franko/html-spreadsheet/blob/gh-pages/html-spreadsheet-show.gif)

It does the following things:

- copy & paste to and from spreadsheet applications
- directly enter or modify data
- delete entire regions of data using the "Delete" button

The scope of HTML-Spreadsheet is limited to the features described above. Do not expect to be able to do everything you can do with Excel.
